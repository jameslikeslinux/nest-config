 * systemd-resolved seems to return the first result received from a combined A
 * and AAAA lookup.  After both results have been cached, both records are
 * returned.  In the first case, if the AAAA record is received first, Firefox
 * will try to connect to the IPv6 site and fail on systems without IPv6
 * connectivity.  A refresh will pull the A record from the resolved cache and
 * succeed.  Enabling the Firefox trusted resolver (DNS-over-TLS) is a
 * workaround that only helps Firefox, but it *greatly* eases the effects of
 * the problem, and improves privacy in the process.
